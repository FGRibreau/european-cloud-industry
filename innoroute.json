Most of InnoRoute‘s enterprise customers use the TrustNode as a node in industrial or automotive communication networks, especially with a custom Time-Sensitive Networking extension. One customer even designed a custom processor module for the TrustNode. InnoRoute‘s academic customers use it for various purposes, like industrial communication networks, general SDN applications, and 5G mobile fronthaul network prototyping. InnoRoute also provides paid custom extensions to the TrustNode and its FPGA code.",
