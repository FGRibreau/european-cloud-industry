One of the challenges in this type of merger is to provide a common and simultaneous level of information to all employees of the group, regardless of the company they belong to. The selection of the most suitable solution for this project was made in September 2014 based on three major axes: autonomy, cost and speed of execution. XWiki adapted the standard XWiki Enterprise platform to the colors of the new group. The engine and its components were installed on SFR-Altice's internal servers. A cluster was also set up in order to face the potentially important load of visits on the intranet.",
