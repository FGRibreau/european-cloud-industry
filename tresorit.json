Browser based applications were commonplace throughout the company, and a migration to Google Workspace 5 years prior to Tresorit’s involvement had driven considerable efficiencies. The next step in Viessmann’s transformation was adding an additional layer of security to departments like R&D and Procurement, who had previously edited and shared documents containing confidential information – like CAD models, patent data and functional specifications – using conventional (and, by definition, unsecure) methods.",

In 2016, one of WILPF’s focus areas is turning the international attention to human rights violations in conflict zones.
