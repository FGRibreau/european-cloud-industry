      "title": "How Le Wagon teaches thousands of students to code with Scalingo",
      "description": "Le Wagon hosted their Ruby on Rails applications on Heroku until they encountered a limitation for their educational platform. The purpose of this application is to test the students' code to see if it is good. The application then sends a message back to the student indicating whether their code is correct or incorrect, similar to continuous integration. The tests designed by the pedagogical team worked well locally on the students' machines but did not run correctly on Heroku, in the absence of SQLIte headers on the machines offered on this PaaS. Following this problem, they turned to Scalingo to host Le Wagon's applications. The goal was to have a stable infrastructure that did not require human intervention.",
