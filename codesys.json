The RondoDry treatment plant for liquid manure and digested residues evaporates up to 4,000 m³ of water per year, thus removing around 70 % of the ammonium nitrogen from the liquid manure. As a result, the liquid manure contains less nitrogen when spread on the land, and storage, transport, and spreading costs are significantly reduced. Another positive effect of the treatment: Heat and biogas are released and can be used for heating and power generation.",
